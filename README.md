# Description
The TempLib library provides functionality related to temperature systems, including temperature sensor scaling, set point ramping, and closed loop control with autotuning.

Nearly every manufacturing process has some dependence on temperature. Whether it is a chemical process that needs to take place at a certain temperature or a pot of glue that needs to be kept hot, maintaining a steady temperature is crucial to success.

The TempLib library provides an easy to use interface for all of the most common tasks associated with temperature control systems, from set point generation to sensor monitoring and control.
